## 🏗️ Development Details

The project follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, ensuring a clean and organized codebase. I also made conventional commits to keep the development process well-documented and easy to understand.

## 📚 My Learning Journey

In developing Books Recorder, I gained invaluable experience in various aspects of web development, including:

📌 Using factories and database seeding to generate seamless testing data. This allowed me to write more robust tests that ensured the application worked as expected.

📌 Implementing file uploads for smooth document handling. This involved using a variety of techniques to ensure that files were uploaded securely and stored efficiently.

📌 Working with Breeze for authentication and authorization features. This allowed me to build a secure application that could be used by users with different levels of permissions.

📌 Making database transactions for data integrity. This ensured that data was always consistent, even in the event of an error.

📌 Using soft deletes for logging. This allowed me to track changes to data without deleting it permanently.

These skills will benefit my future projects by helping me to build more robust, secure, and user-friendly applications.
